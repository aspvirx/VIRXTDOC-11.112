This document adheres to the VIRXTDOC-11.112 documenting standard. The
VIRXTDOC-11.112 format is a simplified technical documenting scheme
developed by VirX.Net Software Innovations Inc. It has been designed to
help simplify complicated technical specifications so that they can be
easily understood by both non-technical (non-tech savvy) stakeholders
and developers alike. Please see the [Document Format
Specification](#6.5.Document Format Specification|outline) section at

VIRXTDOC-11.112 format is a simplified technical documenting scheme

### <span id="anchor-8"></span>Philosophy 

The purpose of any technical document is to communicate, record and
exchange information among associated parties to achieve (or maintain) a
predefined goal. In order to achieve it’s purpose efficiently, the
document must be clear, structured, easy to understand by all parties
involved. Especially by individuals who are non-technical. This can be
achieved by compiling technical information in a fluid story-like format
which describes processes step-by-step. Descriptive explanations of
practical real world use brings life to abstract specifications and
theoretical data. Attributes and characteristics may be outlined in
multilevel ordered lists. Keeping things simple and easy to replicate is
fundamental.

### <span id="anchor-9"></span>Structure

3.  Revision History
4.  Introduction Section

    1.  Document Format: a section to educate the reader about
        VIRXTDOC-11.112
    2.  Purpose: purpose of the document and it’s aspired goal(s)
    3.  Scope: description of the subject matter and scope of the
        document
    4.  Definitions: brief list of important word definitions

5.  Overall Description: detailed description of subject matter
    hierarchically divided by numbered headers.
6.  Other Sections (as required)
7.  Document Format Specification: a copy of the document format
    specification you are reading now.

### <span id="anchor-10"></span>Content Style Guidelines

1.  Explain technical information in a fluid story-like format to
    elaborate abstract specifications and theoretical data.
2.  Describe processes, functions and procedures step-by-step using real
    world practical use and examples.
3.  Outline attributes and characteristics using multi-level
    ordered lists.
4.  Maintain clear and consistent hierarchal organization of content
5.  Keep it simple. Do not unnecessarily over-complicate.
6.  Avoid generalizations and abstruse descriptions/specifications.
7.  Sequential progressions (i.e. data that belong in flow-charts)
    should be represented in written format first and foremost.
8.  Written explanations are compulsory. Diagrams and illustrations
    are secondary.
